This is my version of a dockerized akaunting.

Right now this works for your private network but i haven't
got it working for external proxied service yet.
<<<<<<< HEAD

### Requirements
- External Mysql/ Mariadb server


After the service comes up you can acces it at :3186.

Added an arm32 docker image. To use it cp docker-compose.yml.arm32 to docker-compose.yml then docker-compose up -d, and access it at :3186.
